## Data Types
A mix of online polls, [phone polls](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/02/27/what-our-transition-to-online-polling-means-for-decades-of-phone-survey-trends/), and other physical polls. Main issue to fix is to eliminate (or account) for the [Lizardman's constant](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/12/noisy-poll-results-and-reptilian-muslim-climatologists-from-mars/). Also includes approval polls/trends from previous elections to identify trends that might be correlation to time/season.

Other forms of data include senate races, house races, governor races, etc. Need to explore potential links between local/district races and potential effect on nationwide election/political sentiment (Most interesting would be Cubans in Florida and Asian-Americans in NYC).
